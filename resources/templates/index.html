<h1>Hello!</h1>

<p>You are successfully running Edge.</p>

<p>
  Edge is a demonstration of how you can compose a number of Clojure
  libraries together to form a complete working system.
</p>

<p>
  Edge is Free Software. Use Edge as the basis of your own Clojure web
  project. Edge is ideal for websites, web APIs, micro-services and
  more.
</p>

<section>
  <h1>Web resources</h1>

  <p>
    Edge
    uses <a href="https://juxt.pro/yada"><span class="yada">yada</span></a>
    to handle web requests, a powerful and comprehensive HTTP library
    that delivers on the promises of HTTP as a solid and proven
    architecture for building distributed systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    URI routing is handled
    by <a href="https://github.com/juxt/bidi">bidi</a>, which
    processes a nested data structure containing URI paths, path
    segments and parameters and their mapping
    onto <span class="yada">yada</span> handlers.
  <p>

    <h1>Clock!</h1>

    <p>
      This is a test! I am trying to make a clock and learn how to use edge.

      <li><a href="{% href swagger %}/?url={% url api %}/swagger.json">Swagger UI</a></li>

  <h1>Authentication blog examples</h1>

  <p>There is a blog on JUXT's website about <span class="yada">yada</span> authentication <a href="https://juxt.pro/blog/posts/yada-authentication.html">here</a>. The examples linked below correspond to the examples in the article.</p>

  <section>
    <h1>Basic Authentication</h1>

    <p><a href="{% href basic-authn-example %}">Click here</a> to test in your browser â€“ you'll need to use the user <tt>alice</tt></p>

    <p>Or use the following command test the resource:</p>

    <code class="shell">curl -i {% url basic-authn-example %} -u alice:password</code>

    <p class="question">Question: What is the result if you change the username <tt>alice</tt> for another username?</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h1>Custom Authentication</h1>
    <code class="shell">curl -i {% url custom-auth-trusted-header-resource-example %} -H X-WhoAmI:alice</code>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h1>Form Authentication</h1>
    <p><a href="{% href login-example %}">Login form</a></p>
  </section>

<section>
  <h1>Swagger</h1>

  <p>
    Rather than start with a Swagger specification and generate
    boilerplate code, Edge encourages a fast-turnaround approach where
    the API is declared in Clojure code/data, which generates Swagger
    documentation and handles API requests at the same time. This
    ensures the documentation is always aligned to the code.
  </p>

  <p>
    Edge shows 2 different ways of
    publishing <a href="https://swagger.io">Swagger</a> descriptions
    with <span class="yada">yada</span>. These descriptions have
    multiple uses. For example, you can use a Swagger description to
    generate an API on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using their API
    Gateway Tool, or of course to drive the <a href="{% url swagger
    %}/">Swagger UI</a> which is built in to Edge.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first method is to use <tt>yada/swaggered</tt> to wrap a bidi
    structure containing <span class="yada">yada</span> resources. The
    disadvantage of this approach is that the Swagger description is
    in the same URI hierarchy as your API.
  </p>

  <p>
    The second is more flexible, and allows you to publish your
    Swagger descriptions separately from your API. This is the
    approach demonstrated by the Phonebook example.
  </p>

<section>
  <h1>How it works</h1>

  <p>
    To discover how Edge works, dive into the code in <tt>src</tt>
  </p>

  <p>
    The first place to go is {% source src/edge/system.clj %}.
    This is where the various components of Edge are defined:

    <ul>
      <li>Web Server</li>
      <li>Selmer</li>
      <li>Database</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    {% source src/edge/web_server.clj %} defines a component
    called <tt>WebServer</tt> which listens on a port (3000) and
    declares the virtual hosts and bidi route structures.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>Browser REPL</h1>

  <p>You can upgrade the REPL to a browser REPL</p>

  <pre><code>(cljs-repl)</code></pre>

  <p>Get back to the server repl with `:cljs/quit`</p>

  <p>Alternatively you can connect to the REPL over port 5600</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h1>Configuration</h1>

  <p>
    Configuration can be found in {% source resources/config.edn
    %}. This is a standard EDN file containing tag literals which help
    configure the system for multiple operating
    environments. <a href="https://github.com/juxt/aero">Aero</a> is
    used for reading the configuration file.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>Sass CSS</h1>

  <p>
    To change the style, edit the <tt>.scss</tt> files in
    the <tt>sass</tt> directory. Changes will be compiled
    automatically. If you are building a ClojureScript app, these
    changes will be automatically reloaded into the browser for
    immediate feedback.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>Performance</h1>

  <p>
    Edge uses <span class="yada">yada</span>, which is built on aleph,
    which wraps Netty. Netty is used a large companies such as Google,
    Apple and Facebook for their most demanding workloads. Therefore,
    with the correct tuning, the system will scale. However, there are
    many factors that affect performance and you should measure the
    performance of your overall system to ensure it meets your
    demands.
